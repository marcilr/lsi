LSI


LSI is the best game in town for add-on storage controllers.
Avoid their MegaRAID solutions and stick with their HBAs.
You’ll see three generations of HBAs commonly available today.
The oldest (and slowest) are the SAS 2008 based I/O controllers
such as the 9211 or the very popular IBM M1015.  The next
generation of these controllers was based on the 2308 which
added PCI 3.0 support and increased CPU horsepower on the
controller itself.  An example here is the 9207.  Both the 2008
and 2308 based solutions are 6Gbps SAS parts.  The newest
generation of controllers are 12Gbps parts such as the 9300.
The FreeNAS driver for the 6 Gbps parts is based on version
16 of the stock LSI driver with many enhancements that LSI
never incorporated into their driver.  In addition, many of
the changes after version 16 were specifically targeted at
the Integrated RAID functionality that can be flashed onto
these cards.  As a result, “upgrading” the driver manually
to the newer versions found on the LSI website can actually
result in downgrading its reliability or performance.  I
highly recommend running version 16 firmware on these cards.
It’s the configuration tested by LSI, and it’s the
configuration tested by the FreeNAS developers.  Running
newer firmware should work, however running older firmware
is not recommended or supported as there are known flaws
that can occur by running the FreeNAS driver against a
controller with an older firmware.  FreeNAS will warn you
if the firmware on an HBA is incompatible with the driver.
Heed this warning or data loss can occur.  The newer 12Gbps
parts use version 5 of the LSI driver.  Cards using this
driver should use version 5 of the firmware.

  The only known-good chip is the SAS 3008 and the most popular
  card model is the LSI SAS 9300.

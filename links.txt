Using this card to control drives for a FreeNAS build
and it works great with the FreeNAS drivers.      
...
 I would highly recommend this product to anyone who
needs a lot of drives for a ZFS file system,
particularly FreeNAS -- completely stable.

Inexpensive, No RAID, Just HBA.  Works great with FreeNAS.
Worked right out of the box, no configuring necessary.

Flashing IT Firmware to the LSI SAS9211-8i HBA
Feb 4th, 2012
In the process of upgrading my storage server, I wanted to upgrade the firmware
on my recently acquired LSI SAS9211-8i SAS/SATA 6Gb/s PCI Express card to the
latest IT version rather than the IR version it ships with.

LSI LSI00244 (9201-16i) PCI-Express 2.0 x8 SATA / SAS Host Bus   <===
Adapter Card, Single Pack--Avago Technologies
o 4 x SFF-8087 mini-SAS
o Up to 6Gb/s
o Controller: LSI SAS2116
NOTES:
Does not come with the SFF-8087 mini-SAS cabling
Using this card to control drives for a FreeNAS build
and it works great with the FreeNAS drivers.      
...
 I would highly recommend this product to anyone who
needs a lot of drives for a ZFS file system,
particularly FreeNAS -- completely stable.

Inexpensive, No RAID, Just HBA.  Works great with FreeNAS.
Worked right out of the box, no configuring necessary.
